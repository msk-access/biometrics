# Introduction to Biometrics

Biometrics is a Python package to compute various metrics for assessing sample contamination, sample swaps, and sex validation. The package is composed of five tools:

#### Extract
Running this step is a **prerequisite** before running any of the other tools. This preprocesses your BAM file(s) and stores the result into a python pickle file (which contains JSON data). This allows for much faster analyses that make repeated use of your samples.

#### Genotype


#### Minor contamination


#### Major contamination


#### Sex validation
